### LOCAL PATHS ###

# Template to use (can be absolute, relative to this yml or to staticplayer-gen).
template: templates/default/

# Write website to this folder (absolute or relative to this yml).
outputPath: example-out/

# If defined, audio files will be copied or transcoded to this directory 
# (absolute or relative to this yml).
copyAudioTo: example-out/audio/

# If defined, this exact path or command will be used instead of the default, "ffmpeg".
ffmpegPath: C:\cygwin\usr\local\bin\ffmpeg.exe

# On Linux/OSX, if you reference a playlist with absolute paths on a mounted
# device, it might be necessary to prepend the mount point to the paths.
# Playlists under these mount points will get their paths fixed.
inputPlaylistMountpoints:
    - /media/ipod/


### PUBLIC PATHS AND URLS ###

# Public path for staticplayer. Can be a full URL or a path starting with
# domain root (/) but not a relative path.
publicPath: /

# publicAudioPath follows the same rules as publicPath.
publicAudioPath: /audio/


### DISPLAY SETTINGS ###

# If true, root will be a list of playlists.
# If false, root will be the first playlist (other playlists will be ignored).
multiPlaylist: true

# The title can be overridden for each playlist.
pageTitle: example tiny playlist

# Displayed title and subtitle if we are in multiPlaylist mode.

# unimplemented
autoPlay: false

# unimplemented
startShuffleEnabled: false

# unimplemented

# web player to work correctly across all browsers. You can set this to false
# for experimental purposes.

# Files that are not already CBR MP3 will be transcoded to the following
# bitrate.
bitrate: 192k
